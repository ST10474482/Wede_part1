  <!-- About Content -->
  <section class="about-us">
    <h2>Our Story</h2>
    <p>Belem Bakery was established in the 1970s and has since expanded from a modest family-run business to become one
      of Johannesburg's most well-known Portuguese bakeries. Each item is made by hand using age-old recipes that have
      been handed down through the generations.</p>

    <p>John Lourenço became a silent partner in 2001, and Shaun De Carvalho contributed his skills in hospitality to the
      group in the 2010s. The Belém Café and Restaurant in Glenanda opened as a result, and catering and wholesale
      services were added.</p>
